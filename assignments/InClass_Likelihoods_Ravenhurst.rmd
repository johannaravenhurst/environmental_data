#Let’s say I’ve been conducting counts of Wilson’s Warblers at study sites in Oregon.
#I’ve been to 2 sites where I counted 2, and 6 birds.

x_observed = c(2, 6)
print(x_observed)

#I think I can model the population of birds at the study sites with a Poisson distribution.I know that the Poisson distribution has a single parameter: λ. I also know that the mean and standard deviation of a Poisson distribution are equal to λ

#Choosing a model:
#I think the count of 2 is unusually low, so I decide to propose a Poisson distribution with λ=4.5 as a model of the counts of Wilson’s Warblers on my study sites.

#I can use dpois() to calculate the probability mass for the two counts given a Poisson distribution with λ=4.5
dpois(x = 2, lambda = 4.5)
dpois(x = 6, lambda = 4.5)

#I know the likelihood of observing those particular counts together is the product of the individual likelihoods:

dpois(x = 2, lambda = 4.5) * dpois(x = 6, lambda = 4.5)

#I can take advantage of vectorization in R by storing the counts in a single vector:
wiwa_counts = c(2, 6)
dpois(x = wiwa_counts, lambda = 4.5)

#I can more easily calculate the product now:
prod(dpois(x = wiwa_counts, lambda = 4.5))

#And the sum of log-likelihoods like:

sum(log(dpois(x = wiwa_counts, lambda = 4.5)))

#How would you modify the code to calculate the likelihood using lambda=4.2?
#I would just replace 4.5 with 4.2

#this grouped the 0 and 1 observations together, which is not what we wanted. R decided to make 6 bins.

#We can trick R into only counting the lower endpoint if we cleverly manipulate the sequence that we give to bins.

#This works because the data were discrete counts. It also looks nicer because the bars are now centered over the census counts. This trick doesn't work as well for continuous data.


#If we wanted to use code like this with data for which we didn’t know the maximum value ahead of time we could write:

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

#Q1 (1 pt.): What value for λ did you select?
#I selected λ = 2

#Q2 (1 pt.): How did you choose a value?
#I calculated the sum of log-likelihoods for the range of possible lambda values and selected the lambda that maximized the sum of log-likelihoods.
#However, this involved quite a bit of repeated code. I tried providing a vector of lambda values 2:6 and that didn't work. Maybe the way to do this would be to write a function?

#Questions 10-11

Q10 (1 pt.): Considering a Maximum Likelihood criterion, which model better fit the data?
Maximum Likelihood is looking for the maximum sum of log-likelihoods, so the Poisson model did a better job because the value of the sum was higher. 


Q11 (2 pts.): Considering what you know about the Binomial and Poisson distributions, which model is more appropriate for census count data?

The Poisson distribution is more appropriate for census count data because it is a discrete distribution meant to describe counts. The sample space goes from 0 to infinity.


#Questions 12-14

#Consider a vector of random, normally-distributed numbers:

#We know that the numbers came from a normally-distributed population with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
#How could I calculate the log-likelihood that the observed numbers in the vector came from a standard normal distribution?

#Q12 (1 pt.): Create the vector (make sure you set seed to 1) and calculate the log likelihood that it came from a standard normal distribution.

set.seed(1)
vec_rnorm = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)

sum(log(dnorm(x = vec_rnorm, mean = 0, sd = 1)))
#Answer = -12.01869

#Q13 (2 pts.): Show the R code you used to make the calculation
set.seed(1)
vec_rnorm = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)

sum(log(dnorm(x = vec_rnorm, mean = 0, sd = 1)))



#Q14 (2 pts.): Use the guess and check method to find the maximum likelihood optimal values for mean and standard deviation (to 2 significant figures) of the numbers in the vector.
summary(vec_rnorm)

sum(log(dnorm(x = vec_rnorm, mean = 0.13, sd = 1)))

sum(log(dnorm(x = penguins$flipper_length_mm, mean = 200, sd = 14)), na.rm=FALSE)

#I'm not sure what I am doing wrong here...I keep getting "NA"

#Q15 (1 pt.): How did you choose your starting guess values for mean and standard deviation?
#I calculated the mean and standard deviation from the full dataset to choose my starting values.


#Q16 (2 pts.): Using the guess and check method, what were the maximum likelihood estimates of mean and standard deviation (to 1 significant figure).
