"0","#The t-test suggests that there is good evidence that the flipper length is different between the two species."
"0",""
"0","    #Can you explain why? - The different in the group means was 5.7804 and the p-value was <0.001. This means that if the null hypothesis of no difference between the mean flipper lengths was true and we repeated sampled from these populations, we would have a less than 0.0001 chance of seeing this result. This indicates that we should reject the null hypothesis because it is highly unlikely to be true given these results. "
