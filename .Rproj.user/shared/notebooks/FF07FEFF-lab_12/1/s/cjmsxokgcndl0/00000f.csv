"0"," #I chose the value for a by using the summary function for the data frame and then selecting the maximum value for standardized dispersal rate. I think this makes sense because a is supposed to be the highest point of the exponential curve. In order to find a potential value for b, I calculated a/e = 0.92/e = 0.338. This is the y value at the point where 1/b is equal to the corresponding x value for the exponential curve. When I look at the scatterplot when y is 0.4, I'm guessing that the x value for the fitted exponential curve should be around 450, so 450 = 1/b, which means b=1/450. "
