"0","#The CI includes 0 - the sample means are not significantly different"
"0","#The t-test results indicate that there is not a significant difference in the mean pine seedling counts between the control and clipped treatments"
"0","#There is a large difference in sample means...and we know that the assumptions we need for a t-test are not met in this case because the variances are difference and the clipped sample is not normally distributed. "
