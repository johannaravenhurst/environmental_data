"0","#Q10 (1 pt.): What did you find most difficult about building the function?"
"0","#I didn't find it very difficult to build this function because I used the example from the walkthrough and fixed the error (was I supposed to build something different?). However, I have been finding it difficult to try to build functions from scratch, and I think I would have had a hard time coming up with this function on my own. "
