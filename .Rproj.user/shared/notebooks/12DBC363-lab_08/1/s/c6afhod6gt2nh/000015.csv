"0","#The resampled differences in means do not follow a skewed distribution. The histogram of the boostrapped differences in means looks like a normal distribution, which means it is a symmetrical distribution around the mean. In addition, the mean (-5.856474) and median (-5.86951) values are almost exactly the same, which indicate a symmetrical distribution. I would expect the mean and median to be unequal values for a skewed distribution. "
